# Accounting & Tax Compliance Package

The first step to developing your financial systems, is high-quality compliance. You have to get the bedrock set first before you can build from there. There is no getting around this!

## Compliance services entail:

- Financial statement preparation
- Income Tax return, preparation and filing
- GST return preparation and filing

Working in unison, we will ensure these aspects are taken care of quickly, efficiently and accurately.

Not only do the Directors of a company need these aspects taken care of in order to make business decisions, but if you’re thinking of buying a home, refinancing your mortgage, seeking external growth capital, selling your business, or doing anything that will involve business finances, you can’t do it without a set of financial statements and a good compliance standing.

Once compliance has been taken care of, you’ll have clarity on your business's financial position. From there you can move forward.

## What else is included?

The compliance package includes annual financial statement preparation, income tax return preparation and filing (including personal returns for the directors), tax planning, Xero subscription, incidental calls and emails, plus GST help if needed.

## Added value

As part of coming on board with the compliance package, we will sit down together and break down your business so that we can gain a clear understanding of it all, together. We will discuss what’s working and what’s not.

We will then build a budget forecast that incorporates current trading results and what you would like your finances to look like in future. This is prepared on a month-by-month, granular basis. This will significantly improve your profitability.
