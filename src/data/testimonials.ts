    title: "He is not only experienced and understands small businesses, but he is also very easy to deal with.",
    body: `I was in the process of looking for a new accountant after being with a firm for two years. If Ryan's level of service had been similar to the firm I was with, then this would have prevented me from going ahead with Ryan. I wanted an accountant who would look at my individual business setting instead of treating me just as they do with all their clients.
    
    Since I changed my accounting services to Ryan, what really impressed me was the personal level of service I have received. He wasted no time in getting my end-of-financials prepared and followed up with some great insights on how I can manage my business better. He has a lot of knowledge about small businesses, which is why I see him as the perfect fit for my business.
    
    What I liked most about the services Ryan offers is the fact that I can work with my accountant directly on managing my business tax returns better. This is something I have struggled with previously, but with Ryan, working with him directly on getting my end-of-year income tax and financials completed made the process very smooth.
    
    Quick turnaround time, knowledge and experience with startups and small businesses, and 1:1 support.
    
    I will recommend Ryan's services to anyone looking for a personalized accounting service. He is not only experienced and understands small businesses, but he is also very easy to deal with. He explains things in a way that even a novice will understand, and he always has your business's best interest at heart.`,
